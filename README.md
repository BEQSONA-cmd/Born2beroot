and for my example i choose Oracle (64bit) for linux version
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.27.28 PM.png>) 

1GB RAM is enough for this VM
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.28.08 PM.png>) 

here create a virtual hard disk
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.28.58 PM.png>) 

VDI cuz we have ISO file
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.29.15 PM.png>) 

here we have to choose memory for allocate
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.29.33 PM.png>) 

i put 30.8 cuz im doin bonus, and click "Create"
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 1.30.03 PM.png>)

![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 3.16.56 PM.png>) 

# STEP 6 SET UP OUR VIRTUALMACHINE

here you have to type password to unlock your disk
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 3.18.20 PM.png>) 

and after that you should type your intra as user, and your password for user
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 3.19.45 PM.png>) 

when you are in type 'su' for going to 'root' to have all permissions for your VM, and after that type
```
apt install sudo
```
for installing sudo on your VM
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.04.08 PM.png>) 

after it finishes type 

```
sudo reboot
```
for apply changes
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.05.59 PM.png>) 

after reboot you have to type password again, go to your user , and type 'su' for going on your root, and you have to do that each times you open your VM

after that you have to make user wich one have your intraname as name,
```
sudo adduser btvildia
```
but probably you already have this user, so next you have to make group named 'user42'
```
sudo addgroup user42
```
and you have to add your 'btvildia' user to group named 'user42'
```
sudo adduser btvildia user42
```
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.19.27 PM.png>) 

next we have to install 'openssh-server' and 'vim'
so for start 
```
sudo apt update
```
for update system
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
for install 'openssh-server'

```
sudo apt install vim
```
for install vim (text editor)
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.24.25 PM.png>) 

next we have to find directory where we have 'etc'
and type 
```
vim etc/ssh/ssh_config
```
for editing some standart ssh configuration files
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.36.25 PM.png>) 

so here we have to uncomment 'port' and replace number with 4242,

so for savin this file you have to press 'esc' after finish editing, next type ':' with your keyboard, afther that type 'wq' and press 'enter'
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.43.13 PM.png>) 

nex we have to edit other file also, so type this
```
vim etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
and remember this are different files we edit "ssh_config" and "sshd_confid"
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.50.52 PM.png>) 

here you also have to uncomment and change port to 4242, and uncomment PermitRootLogin, for saving use similar method as previous
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 4.58.50 PM.png>) 

now for checking your ssh status type
```
sudo service ssh status
```
it should be "active (running)" and port should be set on 4242
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.03.39 PM.png>)

now we have to install and make active UFW(Uncomplicated firewall) so we have to run this commands
```
sudo apt install ufw
```
for installing UFW
```
sudo ufw enable
```
for enable your firewall
```
sudo ufw allow 4242
```
to allow UFW on 4242 port
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.08.16 PM.png>) 

and 
```
sudo ufw status
```
for check if your ufw is active on your ports
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.09.34 PM.png>) 

and we also have to instal per_package modules for password from here
```
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.32.00 PM.png>) 

nex we have to configure sudo policies
```
mkdir /var/log/sudo
```
for create directory
```
touch /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
```
for create configuration file
```
vim /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
```
and this for edit our config file
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.16.15 PM.png>) 

for how many password try we have.
for mesaage when password fails.
for show where the log file has to be saved in.
for "The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons".
for the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.24.20 PM.png>) 

for setup passsword policy you have to edit this file
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.25.36 PM.png>) 

and change this numbers as in picture
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.26.46 PM.png>) 

for edit you have to open this file :
```
vim /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
and add this commands after "pam_pwquality.so" 
```
minlen=10 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root
```
for minimun characters password should have.
for password should have capital letter.
for password should have lowercase letter.
for password should have digit.
for password should not have 3 same character.
for password should not have username inside.
for password can not have the same character repited three contiusly times.
for password should have 7 different character from last password.
for implement this policy to root.
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.38.38 PM.png>)

```
for shutdown :)
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.40.19 PM.png>) 

# STEP 7 SET UP SSH CONNTECTION

now we have to add port 4242 to out VM
so follow steps:
open settings,
go to Network,
go to Advanced,
and Port Forwarding.
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.41.55 PM.png>) 

click "+" icon on top right corner
and type 4242 in "Host Port" and "Guest Port"
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.43.15 PM.png>) 

next when you start your VM you can connect via ssh from your shell.
so start your VM:
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.46.29 PM.png>) 

and open shell
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 5.49.58 PM.png>) 

when shell is open type:
```
ssh yourintra@localhost -p 4242
```
to connect.
and next type "Yes"
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 6.20.33 PM.png>) 

# STEP 8 SET UP MONITORING

now we can continue using VM from our shell, 
so type:
```
su
```
for go to sudoers.
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 6.23.23 PM.png>) 

we have to make file named "Monitoring.sh" (from subject)
and edit this file to show us all the info they are asking in subject.
so create file:
```
touch monitoring.sh
```
and start editing:
```
vim monitoring.sh
```
![Alt text](<Photos/Screen Shot 2024-01-15 at 6.26.26 PM.png>) 

so here is all commands for all the info what we want our monitoring to show us.

```
info=$(uname -a)

cpu=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)

cpuv=$(grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)

ruse=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}')
